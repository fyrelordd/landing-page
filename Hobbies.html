<li><h2>Reading</h2></li>
<P>I often read fantasy books as way to relax and let off some steam</P>
<p>Here are some of my personal bests:
    <ol>
        <li>A Song of Ice and Fire</li>
        <li>Nancy Drew Mysteries</li>
        <li>The Hardy Boys</li>
        <li>Harry Potter</li>
        
        
    </ol>
</p>
<p>Well, that doesn't seem to be quite a lot, so I'm open for recommendations. currently reading "the hobbit"</p>

<li><h2>Drawing</h2></li>
<p>Drawing is something I've loved since I was a child. Truthfully, I've been incosistent with it, but life goes on eh?</p>

<li><h2>Watching Films</h2></li>
<p>Alone and unbothered? might be time to watch something</p>
<p>Here are some of my top films ever:
    <ol>

        <li>A Game of Thrones</li>
        <li>The Last Airbender</li>
